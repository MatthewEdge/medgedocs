# Concurrency

Concurrency is when two or more tasks can start, run, and complete in overlapping time periods.
It doesn’t necessarily mean, though, that they’ll ever both be running at the same instant
(e.g., multiple threads on a single-core machine).

# Parallelism

Parallelism is when two tasks literally run at the same time
(e.g., multiple threads on a multicore processor).

## Note

Concurrent systems can be parallelized. Parallel systems may not be inherently concurrent.
